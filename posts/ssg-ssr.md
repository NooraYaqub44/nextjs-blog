Long gone now are the days of everyone raiding stores for hydro flasks and seashell necklaces. Even drawing hearts on our faces and wearing chains while calling that style an “E-Girl” is out of trend. If you’ve been on TikTok at any point during the last few weeks, you might have noticed a new version of these trendy styles rising.

“That girl” has been circulating a lot of our feeds lately, so what exactly is “that girl”? Well, someone who is “that girl” is someone who prioritizes themselves in a good way! Spending time to work on themselves, eating foods that make them feel good, being productive, and working on bettering themselves… That is who “that girl” is. A lot of what is shown to us is all about the aesthetic, and while that’s a massive part of it, becoming “that girl” is more of a mindset than having the picture-perfect life.



What Does Being “THAT Girl” Look Like?
You become “that girl” in your own way— someone's portrayal of becoming “that girl” will look very different to yours, or anybody else's. Becoming “that girl” resembles wellness, making positive changes in your life, and pushing yourself every day to become a better person. “That girl” is all about wellness both physically and mentally. You don’t need to be the fittest girl in the world and eat the healthiest foods every day. It's all about bettering yourself and doing those things all on your own time and for you only.



Make Healthy Habits
To start your “that girl” journey, you need to start by making healthy habits and thinking of what areas you want to better yourself in. “That girl” is seemingly a well-put-together and organized person. Start by thinking about how you can become her. Do you want to get in better shape for hot girl summer? Maybe you want to get better grades or just generally improve your well-being. If you're one for hitting snooze, aim to get up earlier. Or if you're always finding your space messy, spend some time cleaning! Make healthy habits for your well-being, like remembering to stay hydrated throughout the day and cutting down on sweet treats.

Set Realistic Goals
There's nothing worse than setting a goal that you can’t reach or can’t complete because of how unrealistic it is. It's easy for us to set goals based on an ultimate dream or whim. Aim to set frequent short-term goals that you can check off to feel success and pride instead of feeling guilty of not reaching them. “That girl” is always achieving what she puts her mind to. Aim to set a weekly or fortnightly goal that’s realistic and achievable, all while being a little challenging at the same time.

Fuel Your Body
“That girl” is not all about eating healthier foods. But eating foods that make you feel good, include fresh produce, and are meals that you enjoy eating are essential to becoming that girl. Foods with less processed fats and high sugar levels are a great start! Learn to cook meals from home and eat less takeout. Eating healthy doesn’t always mean salads and plain foods, so do some research and find foods that are good for your body while being delicious. Alternate every so often from a bag of chips to a platter of fruit enriched with nutrients that fuel and nourish the body.





Enrich Yourself With Power
Glowing skin and good food isn’t all what becoming “that girl” is about. You need to be constantly learning and evolving. That girl is always looking to learn and take in new information in all areas of her life. This may be in your school work, where you want to work on becoming more focused and productive. Or it could be that you want to learn more about certain personal aspects such as self-confidence. Enrich yourself in information by taking different classes, listening to powerful mentors, starting new podcasts, and reading more books. You’ll gain power from becoming a more knowledgeable version of yourself.

Move Your Body
Exercise— it’s either loved or hated by everyone. Whether you are someone who has a workout routine and frequently goes to the gym, or someone who neglects it, it’s equally important to fit it into our lives. It’s advised that you move your body for at least half an hour a day to stay well, so try to fit in some form of movement in your day-to-day life. “That girl” is always moving, productive and motivated. You don’t need exercise to lose weight unless that's your goal, but do it because you want to and want to better yourself. Exercising releases endorphins that stimulate us to make ourselves happier, so add a simple walk or run around your neighborhood into your day.





Is There a Toxic Side to Being “That Girl”?
It’s talked about among a few that “that girl” is a toxic mindset. While it’s portrayed by many that it’s all about staying skinny and healthy, that’s not what it’s about. A toxic mindset is when you feel forced to do something and feel forced to look and appear a certain way, and the truth is, becoming that girl doesn’t look the same for everyone. You don’t have to have the intention of becoming perfect or skinnier, you just have to have the intention of bettering yourself. Bettering yourself doesn’t mean looking better, it means feeling better internally and feeling more content, happy and confident within yourself.

Take Care of Yourself
“That girl” is always on top of skincare and has glowing skin, so develop a skin-care routine if you don't have one already. Do something nice for yourself as often as possible, such as changing up your hair or getting your nails done at a salon. Wear clothes that you love and make you feel good within yourself. Outfits that make you feel confident and happy should always be worn. When you're taking care of yourself, you're acknowledging self-love and prioritizing yourself, which on its own makes you “that girl” already.



My Experience With Trying to Become “That Girl”
I first saw this concept on TikTok and thought it was an amazing way to promote a better lifestyle, while being a motivational factor to make myself become a better person. I now enrich myself with different educational and influential podcasts, and set frequent goals. I aim to maintain a healthier lifestyle from eating to exercising, and I have made it a top priority to look after my mental and physical well-being.

While I’m not perfect (who is?), it's made me strive to become a better version of myself each and every day. And that is what becoming “that girl” is all about.
